Code in this repository can be used to build a DLL that makes ADO/ADOX capabilities available to C and C++ applications compiled with MinGW.  A binary version of the DLL is also included.

At the heart of this project is code originally written by Carlos Antollini: please see http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1075/A-set-of-ADO-classes-version.
